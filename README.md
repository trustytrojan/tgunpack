[latest release - curseforge pack](https://github.com/trustytrojan/tgunpack-forge-1.12.2/releases/download/rolling/tgunpack.zip)

## setup guide
install [prismlauncher](https://prismlauncher.org), open it, and follow these steps:
1. click `Add Instance` at the top
2. select `Import` on the left and paste [this link](https://github.com/trustytrojan/tgunpack-forge-1.12.2/releases/download/rolling/tgunpack.zip) in the `Local file or link to a direct download:` box
3. if you're prompted to download the lucky block jar (don't know why this happens), just click the curseforge link it gives and help prism locate the downloaded jar

if you want to use another launcher, then you're on your own.
