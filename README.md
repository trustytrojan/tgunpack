## setup guide
- if you use [prismlauncher](https://prismlauncher.org) (RECOMMENDED):
	1. click `Add Instance` at the top
	2. select `Custom` on the left and choose `1.12.2` as the `Version` in the middle, then press `OK`
	3. right click on the newly created instance and click `Folder` to open the instance folder in File Explorer
	4. download `mods.7z` from the latest release, open it in File Explorer, and copy all the `.jar` files into the `mods` folder of your instance folder that was opened in step 3
- if you use the official launcher:
	1. get the [forge 1.12.2 installer jar](https://maven.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/1.12.2-14.23.5.2860/forge-1.12.2-14.23.5.2860-installer.jar)
	2. open it. if nothing happens, you need to install [java 8](https://www.java.com/download) on your system, then try again
	3. open File Explorer and paste `%AppData%\.minecraft` in the path bar at the top and press Enter
	4. download `mods.7z` from the latest release, open it in File Explorer, and copy all the `.jar` files into the `mods` folder of your instance folder that was opened in step 3
- if you're using another launcher you probably know how to do all of this
