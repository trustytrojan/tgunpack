download/import links:
- [curseforge pack](https://github.com/trustytrojan/tgunpack-forge-1.12.2/releases/download/rolling/tgunpack.zip): includes recommended configs/settings
- [curseforge pack - mods only](https://github.com/trustytrojan/tgunpack-forge-1.12.2/releases/download/rolling/tgunpack-modsonly.zip): has no configs/settings - this is for if you want to configure the client-side mods yourself

for other minecraft setups: i'll come up with an easy solution soon

## setup guide
1. install [prismlauncher](https://prismlauncher.org) and open it
2. click `Add Instance` at the top
3. select `Import` on the left, copy one of the `curseforge pack` links above, and paste it in the `Local file or link to a direct download:` box
4. if you're prompted to download the lucky block jar (still don't know why this happens), just follow the instructions in the dialog

## connecting to the server
use one of the following addresses:
- `mc.trustytrojan.dev:9787`
- `147.185.221.25:9787`
- `25.ip.gl.ply.gg:9787`

## updating the pack
1. open [prismlauncher](https://prismlauncher.org)
2. repeat steps 2 & 3 of the [setup guide](#setup-guide)
3. a dialog will popup saying `Similar modpack was found!`, click the `Update existing instance` button

## other launchers
if you want to use another launcher, then you're on your own
